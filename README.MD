# What is this?

This project was an experimental browser made in JavaFX to demonstrate its abilities and to demonstrate my ability to make a project in the javafx framework.

# Should I use this for browsing the web?

Absolutely not! There are no security features in this browser and it is exceedingly slow due to the fact that is written in java.

# How do I build it?

Simply run the build.bat file or the build.sh file and the resulting JavaFXBrowser.jar should appear in the main directory
